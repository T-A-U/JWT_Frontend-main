## CAPSTONE FRONT END

To be used with CAPSTONE BACKEND (https://github.com/T-A-U/CAPSTONE-BACKEND)

### Summary

This website is a video games storefront website built with React, CSS, Tailwind CSS, Express, Mongoose, Node, and MongoDB. 

I wanted to build a website that spoke to my passion for creativity and gaming. React is a very difficult framework for newer engineering students to understand, but I am constantly learning and growing and I have learned so much from this project and course. Thank you everyone.

### Routes

This application has a create route (post), read route (get), update route (put) and delete route in the backend project. I use a jwt token to help with user authentication (thank you Dylan for your help), and showcase my custom api on one of the pages. 

## Difficulties

As stated before, React is difficult to understand for me but I am starting to get the hang of things, slowly but surely. Initially, my authentication was not working, so I ripped out all of the code and started over. Dylan luckily helped me put it all back together and even helped debug a few errors. I then tried to create a backend route which fed all the way from the user input all the way to the database, but I had a few errors even though I did a lot of coding on that potential feature, so I commented that out. 

## Future Developments

I don't give up so I'll be continuing to work on this project and make it better.I want to figure out the end to end functionality for not one but all of my routes, also, I would like to create a shopping cart and allow people to purchase items (and delete them from the database) once bought. I'd also one day like to generate emails letting people know they have bought an item from the virtual store.
